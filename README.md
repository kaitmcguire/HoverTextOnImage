# HoverTextOnImage
This allows you to create hover text over different parts of an image with just CSS and HTML.

You can see the example in action [here](https://kaitmcguire.github.io/HoverTextOnImage/).
I've added links in my hovertext to show how it would work, and both the paws and nose have hover text.
